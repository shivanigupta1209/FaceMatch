# FaceMatch
# Deepfake Detection Project

This project is a DeepFake detection tool using facial recognition libraries such as DeepFace and InsightFace. It processes images and videos to identify whether faces are altered or synthetically generated using facial attribute analysis and embeddings comparison.

## 🚀 Features

- Face detection and alignment using DeepFace and InsightFace.
- Face embedding comparison to determine authenticity.
- Integration with machine learning tools for accuracy metrics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `RenewBuy.ipynb`: The core Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: To exclude unnecessary files from your Git repo.
